# Hyperkill.org-Food_Blog_Backend 👩🏼‍🍳🧇🧇🧇
#### Graduated project of SQL with Python at Hyperskill.org

# 
In this project you have to implement a backend app to store GrandMa's secret recipes and search through them from the command line.

## Features

* I'm amazed how ORM and ODM save you a lot of coding time providing you a solid framework to map your entities from and to database easily. So in this project I play to build a nano ORM to handle SQLITE3 databases. 🔥🔥🔥 

* I structure it using repository pattern.
